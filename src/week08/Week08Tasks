1. Create a custom class named Carpet with the following specifications:

    Attributes:
        width
        length
        unitPrice
        isPersian

    Actions:
        calcCost(): Calculates and returns the total price of the carpet.

        The formula to calculate the price of the carpet is as follows:
                Total price of carpet = (width * length) * unitPrice
                If the carpet is a Persian carpet, add $200 to the totalPrice.

        toString(): Returns a string representation of the carpet object with full information, including the total cost calculated by calcCost().



   Create another class named CarpetClients, create multiple carpet objects, and test the function of each carpet object.

2. Create a java class hotel which will allow you to check into a hotel.

          Welcome to the Java Hotel //sout
          How many days will you stay //sout
          -> read number of days from console  //Scanner nextInt();
          How many people are in your party //sout
          -> read number of people from console //Scanner nextInt();

      In addition, declare these variables:
